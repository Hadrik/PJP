# Lexical analyzer

Write a program, that reads an input and converts it into a sequence of lexical symbols – tokens. Each token is a pair, it composes fo a type and possibly a value.
The tokens definition depends on you, and it is considered a part of the solution.

# Input specification

The input may be containing the following symbols:
- identifiers - consisting of a sequence of letters and numbers starting with a letter
- numbers - formed by a sequence of decimal digits
- operators - symbols `'+', '-', '*' and '/'`
- delimiters - symbols `'(', ')' and ';'`
- keywords - `div` and `mod`

Symbols can be separated by a sequence of spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
There can be notes in the input. Notes are preceded by a sequence `//` and continue to the end of the line.
White spaces and notes does not produce any lexical symbols.

# Output specification

Converts the given input into a sequence of tokens and write them on output. Write each token on a separated line.

# Example

- Input

```
    -2 + (245 div 3);  // note
2 mod 3 * hello
```

- Output

*Your output can be different, it depends on your definition of tokens.*

```
OP:-
NUM:2
OP:+
LPAR
NUM:245
DIV
NUM:3
RPAR
SEMICOLON
NUM:2
MOD
NUM:3
OP:*
ID:hello
```
